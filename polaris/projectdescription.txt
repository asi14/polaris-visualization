We created this project at MHacks 11 for Polaris' "Work Hard, Play Hard" Challenge, in which we were given a dataset of ~50,000 rides from Polaris vehicles and were tasked with creating an app or data visualization for it.
We chose to create a web app that would select a random ride from the dataset each time a user accessed the site, plot its path on a Google Maps map, and present the key ride data.
The backend was built with Django and the Google Maps API, the frontend was built using HTML and CSS, and we parsed/analyzed the dataset using the pandas library.
